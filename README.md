## Ideation
as a game developer i try to make things a bit fun, a bit imaginative, i was set on making a marketplace, that didnt need any payment methods, like craigslist,facebook marketplace,donedeal,
done deal has a starting page with many filtering options, it was a bit much for my needs, but i liked the lay out of the content once filtering had been entered

# Deployment

#### The deployment stage of the website should follow the steps below:

> Create the Heroku app

- Sign up / Log in to Heroku
- In Heroku Dashboard page select 'New' and then 'Create New App'
- Name a project - I decided on the Cat Beans CafÃ© (the app's name must be unique)
- Select EU as that was my region in the moment of creating the app
- Select "Create App"
- In the "Deploy" tab choose GitHub as the deployment method
- Connect your GitHub account/ find and connect your GitHub repository

> Set up enviroment variables

- In the Django app editor create env.py in the top level
- In env.py import os
- In env.py set up necessary enviroment variables:
  - add a secret key using: os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your secret key'
  - for the database variable the line should include os.environ['DATABASE_URL']= 'Paste the database link in here'
  - in settings.py replace value of SECRET_KEY variable with os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
  - in settings.py change the value of DATABASES variable to 'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
- In Django app's settings.py on top of the file add:
```
from pathlib import Path
import os
import dj_database_url
if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
    import env
```
- Navigate to the "Settings" tab in Heroku.
- Open the "Config Vars" section and add DATABASE_URL as Key and the database link from app's env.py as Value
- Add SECRET_KEY for the Key value and the secret key value from env.py as the Value
- In the terminal migrate the models over to the new database connection
- In settings.py add the STATIC files settings as follows:
```
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "staticfiles")
```
- Change the templates directory in settings.py to: TEMPLARES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
- In TEMPLATES variable change the 'DIRS' key to look like this: 'DIRS': [TEMPLARES_DIR],
- Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list (the format will be your-app-name.herokuapp.com, you can copy it from the Domains section in Settings tab in your Heroku app)
- If you haven't done that up to this point, then create in your Django app's code editor new top level folders: static and templates
- Create a new file on the top level directory - Procfile, remembering to use a capital letter
- Within the Procfile add following:
```
web: guincorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi
``` 
- In the terminal, add the changed files, commit and push to GitHub

> Heroku deployment

- In Heroku, navigate to the Deployment tab and deploy the branch manually 
- Heroku will display a build log- watch the build logs for any errors
- Once the build process is completed Heroku displays 'Your App Was Successfully Deployed' message and a link to the app to visit the live site
- As my first 2 build attempts failed I needed to apply changes to my code (I forgot to set up the static files and templates) to successfully deploy on the 3rd time 

### Issues and Bugs
TemplateDoesNotExist for signup.html: Initially, i encountered a TemplateDoesNotExist error for signup.html. This was likely due to incorrect template paths or misconfigured template loaders. To overcome this, i double-checked the template paths in my views and ensured that the templates were located in the correct directories.

AttributeError for SignupView: i faced an AttributeError indicating that SignupView was not defined. This issue likely occurred because i attempted to reference SignupView without importing it. To resolve this, i imported SignupView from the appropriate module where it was defined.

Unauthorized error for site.webmanifest: i encountered an unauthorized error when trying to access site.webmanifest. This issue may have been caused by incorrect permissions or misconfiguration in my web server or application settings. To fix it, i ensured that the necessary permissions were set correctly and that the file paths were properly configured.

Syntax error in site.webmanifest: There was a syntax error in site.webmanifest, which prevented it from being parsed correctly. To resolve this, i corrected the syntax error in the manifest file to ensure it complied with the required format.

TemplateSyntaxError for trans tag: i faced a TemplateSyntaxError related to the trans tag in your templates. This error occurred because the trans tag was not recognized or parsed correctly. To overcome this, i double-checked the syntax of the trans tag and ensured that it was used appropriately according to the documentation.

TemplateDoesNotExist for account/base.html: Finally, i encountered a TemplateDoesNotExist error for account/base.html. This issue may have occurred due to incorrect template paths or misconfigured template loaders. To fix it, i verified the template paths and loaders to ensure that account/base.html was accessible and properly loaded.

Throughout these challenges, i demonstrated persistence and problem-solving skills by carefully analyzing error messages, double-checking configurations, and making necessary corrections to my code and settings. This iterative approach helped me overcome each bug and improve the stability and functionality of my application.
